	</h1>
	
<h3><img id="ourpic" src="2015_robot.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float: right;"/>During January to April of 2015, Team 4533 participated in the game Recycle Rush. It involves picking up and stacking
totes on scoring platforms, putting pool noodles inside recycling containers, and putting the containers on top of scoring stacks of totes. Alliances can also pool and stack their totes, dividing the field 
to gain additional points. Human players can also throw noodles across the field.

	</h1>
	
<h3><img id="ourpic" src="2016_robot.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float: right;"/>FIRST introduced Stronghold during the 2016 season. An alliance of three robots attempt to cross field obstacles
as well as weakening the opposing alliance's towers by throwing "boulders" into the goals at the top and bottom of the towers. During the last stages of the game, the robots have the oppurtunity to 
climb their own tower to gain additional points for the alliance before the game ends. Team 4533 mainly focused on overcoming the field obstacles and defending the field from opposing robots. 4533 
competed at the Smokey Mountains and Palmetto Reigonal, where the team ended with a 5-5 and 5-7 record.

airship. Robots can also shoots whiffleballs representing fuel into the boilers on the edges of the field in an attempt to break a stalemate to gain a small advantage over the opponent. During the last 30 
seconds of the match, robots can climb the airships before the timer reaches 0 to gain an additional 50 points for each robot that has successfully climbed.
